Notes:
- look into logging & security, cross cutting concerns
- build in more error catching/safety
- make sure to have comprehensive logout functionality
    - logout btn
    - cookie expiry
    - onabort
    - lobby vs session
- can't double login

Setup frontend/login page
- try to sql inject
- validate & saniztize data
- Advanced features: captcha, admin page, pwd reset...
- more responsive


Setup lobby page
- all players in lobby can chat with eachother
    - websockets
- a player can choose a competitor to challenge
    - button next to each player on list
    - can't challenge self
- once the competitor accepts, both players are redirected to the game page
    - some kind of popup message
    - Notify challenger if that user exits lobby?

Setup game page
- if no session token, redirect
- outline
- need to think about how i am storing all game states
- quit to lobby button?
